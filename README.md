# Dimension‑reduction‑Clustering

**Supplementary information for “Mantle source affinities and evolution models of Indian Ocean hotspots revealed by dimension‑reduction clustering”.**

This repository contains the code workflow for performing dimensionality reduction using **UMAP** and clustering via **HAC**, along with associated parameter‑optimization routines.

> **Note**: This repository does **not** include data‑cleaning code.

## Usage

- The main program file is `main_UMAP_HAC.py`.  
  **Please run this file to execute the workflow.**

- Before running, ensure that:
  1. The file path and filename are correctly set in the script.
  2. Data column names match the expected format to avoid runtime errors.

## Data

If you require the corresponding dataset, please download it from the supplementary materials of the paper:
